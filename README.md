https://i.ibb.co/WN3JwmQy/Screenshot-20251023-200616-Chrome.jpg

This project is a single-page web application that serves as a personalized map where authenticated users can save specific locations, track their real-time location, search for saved places, calculate routes, and even draw and save custom routes. It utilizes **Leaflet.js** for interactive mapping and **Firebase** for a complete backend solution (Authentication and Realtime Database).

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).
* **Real-time Location Tracking:** Track and display your live GPS location and accuracy circle on the map.
* **Saved Places (Markers):**
    * Add custom markers to the map by clicking a location.
    * Save places with a custom name to the Firebase Realtime Database.
    * Double-click a marker to prompt for deletion.
* **Place Search:** Search for saved places with auto-suggestions.
* **Routing:**
    * **Path:** Calculate the shortest driving route between your live location and a saved place using Leaflet Routing Machine.
    * **Draw:** Enter a route-drawing mode to click points on the map and create a custom route polyline.
    * **Reach:** Display the closest *saved custom route* to a specified destination.
* **Data Persistence:** All saved places and custom routes are persistent and specific to the logged-in user through Firebase Realtime Database.
* **Map Base Layer:** Uses Google Satellite imagery.
* **Multilingual Support:** Uses Hindi text for UI elements (e.g., login, register, place names).
